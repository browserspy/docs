![](.gitbook/assets/logo-horizontal.png)

[BrowserSpy](https://browserspy.io) is a hosted service for recording your websites. All developers will have experienced the heart-sinking moment where their boss or a client asks them to fix "a bug", but has no idea what they did and can't really describe the problem. Now you can actually watch a recording of their session and see exactly what happened.
